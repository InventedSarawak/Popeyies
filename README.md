<p align="center">Meme Saber for Game Jam 2024, inspired by Beat Saber</p>

## Background
Imagine a world where memes come to life, and you find yourself in the midst of it.

You, the player, start by watching reels on your device, enjoying the latest and funniest memes of the internet.

As you delve deeper into the reels, an unexpected glitch occurs, transporting you from your world to the vibrant and chaotic realm of memes.

You find yourself standing in an otherworldly space, surrounded by floating meme fragments and distorted reality.
